**The [Reps Portal](https://reps.mozilla.org) has been replaced by the [Community Portal](https://community.mozilla.org).
Therefore this project is archived.**

The [Mozilla Reps portal](https://reps.mozilla.org/) provides the tools for Reps to be successful
in their day to day activities and also receive mentorship for
continued development. It also provides metrics for understanding
and evaluating Mozilla's grass-roots community engagement efforts.
