    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <h4>What is Mozilla Reps?</h4>
    <p>Community is the backbone of the Mozilla project. As the
    project grows in scope and scale, community needs to be
    strengthened and empowered accordingly. This is the central aim of the
    Mozilla Reps program: to empower Mozillians and help push
    responsibility to the edges of the community.</p>
    <h4>Who can be a Mozilla Rep?</h4>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program is open to anyone passionate and knowledgeable
    about the Mozilla project and its community. Because
    becoming a Mozilla Rep involves taking on new responsibilities, a
    Mozillian who signs up will be asked to fill out a short
    application form and be interviewed on IRC by member(s) of the
    Mozilla Rep council, made up of veteran Mozilla volunteers and
    staff. NB: you must be 18 years or older to apply.</p>
    <h4>What sort of activities do Mozilla Reps do?</h4>

    and tasks to fulfill in order to stay on the program:</p>

    <h4>How is Mozilla Reps different from Student Reps?</h4>
    <p>Mozilla Reps aims to empower Mozillians to represent Mozilla in
    their country or region, not just in a university setting, and
    offers participants a much wider set of tools and resources. Also,
    while the Student Reps program is open to anyone who applies,
    Mozilla Rep applicants need to be “accepted” into the program
    through a short interview process. NB: you must be 18 years or
    older to apply.</p>
    <h4>What are the incentives for becoming a Mozilla Rep?</h4>
    <p>There are many reasons that motivate Mozillians to join the
    Mozilla Reps program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Represent Mozilla officially and help push the project
      forward in your country</li>
      <li>Get access to specific tools and resources to organize your
      own events and get sponsorship to attend others</li>
      <li>Share your passion for Mozilla in an organized, structured
      and impactful way while having fun</li>
      <li>Gain valuable experience and learn new leadership skills</li>
      <li>Make new friends and work closely with Mozilla staff around the world</li>
      <li>Build a reputation within the Mozilla community and build your own network</li>
      <li>Travel across your country and attend Mozilla events around the world</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Do I get paid for being a Mozilla Rep?</h4>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program is 100% volunteer based. Just like
    other functional areas of the Mozilla project, the support and
    energy of people all around the world is the backbone of Mozilla's
    open source model. While Mozilla does not offer paid positions for
    participating in the program, the Mozilla Reps program does
    provide specific tools and unique access to people and resources
    (including funding) that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
    <h4>Where can I find and get in touch with other Mozilla Reps?</h4>
    <p>All Mozilla Reps have a profile page on the Mozilla Reps
    website and each page is listed on the Mozilla Rep
    website <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/">people
    page</a>.
    <h4>How can I get Mozilla swag?</h4>
    <p>Mozilla Reps have access to a special Swag Request form for
    events they are organizing or attending. Each request is reviewed
    and approved or rejected by the Mozilla Rep council, based on a
    specific set of criteria. Mozilla Reps can also request Mozilla
    Rep-specific swag such as t-shirts, stickers and buttons that they
    are strongly encouraged to wear when attending events.</p>
    <h4>Can I produce my own localized swag?</h4>
    <p>When the Mozilla Reps program gets out of beta, Mozilla Reps
    will have access to a special tool that enables them to customize
    a specific set of swag and download the designs in PDF format for
    local production.</p>
    <h4>Can I request and manage my own budget for an event?</h4>
    <p>Mozilla Reps have access to a special Budget Request form for
    events they are organizing or attending, or for reimbursement for
    any events for which they had a budget approved. Each request is
    reviewed and approved or rejected by the Mozilla Rep council,
    based on a specific set of criteria.</p>
    <h4>Who runs Mozilla Reps and how is the program organized?</h4>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program is a community-driven program. Both
    Mozilla Reps themselves and Mozilla staff oversee and run the
    program, and plan to continuously improve it. For more information
    on the organizational structure and governance of the program,
    click <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Structure_Governance">here</a>.</p>
    <h4>If a Mozillian is already contributing to a specific area of
    the Mozilla project can that Mozillian also be a Mozilla Rep?</h4>
    <p>Yes, absolutely! In fact, most Mozilla Reps are veteran Mozilla
    contributors who have been promoting the project for a long
    time. Of course, becoming a Mozilla Rep might in some cases
    require them to spend less time contributing to these projects,
    but that will quickly be offset by all the new contributors that
    Mozilla Reps will be recruiting to work on those projects :)</p>
    <h4>Is the Mozilla Reps program aimed at replacing existing community efforts?</h4>
    <p>No, absolutely not. Mozilla Reps is designed precisely to
    strengthen existing community efforts by providing tools and
    resources to help push responsibility and authority to Mozillians
    and help them support their communities better.</p>
    <h4>Can there be several Mozilla Reps in the same country or locale?</h4>
    <p>YYes, there is no limit to the number of Mozilla Reps in a particular
    geographic location. As the Mozilla Reps program grows, regional coordinators
    will be elected or designated by Mozilla Reps to help monitor and coordinate
    the program at the regional level. These regional coordinators will be
    the interface between Mozilla Reps and the Mozilla Rep council.</p>
